Earn computer game credits by working!

I love games but hate how long I play them for without working. It's a simple idea, use the work timer to earn credits (a credit earned for every half hour worked) which you can then reimberse using the play timer.

Select how many credits you want to spend and play away guilt free!

Eventually I should be able to use this application to "lock down" my steam library, so I can't even attempt to play a game without earning and spending credits.
